title: About Me
---

I am an enthusiastic engineer interested in web development, mobile app development, and embedded systems. I am passionate about creating products and services that enrich people's lives. I studied electrical engineering at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo where I received my bachelors degree in 2009. For the first four years of my career, I worked in the communications equipment industry developing software, testing systems, and sustaining hardware projects. I started an online business called Crispytronics selling breakout boards for electronics projects.  I currently work at The Control Group writing software in Go.
